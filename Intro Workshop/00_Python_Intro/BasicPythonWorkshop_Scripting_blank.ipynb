    "# Conditional Statements\n",
    "The conditional statements follow the general conventions of most languages. One thing to note about conditionals is that there are constraints on comparing different object types. For example, you cannot compare a list to another object with conditionals. But you can compare a `numpy array` to an integer or float (this compares every element in the array).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Most common conditionals\n",
    "\n",
    "* equal: `a == b`\n",
    "* not equal: `a != b`\n",
    "* less than: `a < b`\n",
    "* less than or equal: `a <= b`\n",
    "* greater than: `a > b`\n",
    "* greater than or equal: `a >= b`\n",
    "\n",
    "## The `is` conditional\n",
    "There is another conditional that you may not commonly see in another language, which is `is`. This conditional checks that the objects that are being referenced are the same, or share the same identity. Essentially it means that they have the same `id`. This is different from the `==` sign because the `==` sign actually checks if the objects are equal, and not just referencing the same object.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The `in` conditional\n",
    "Another useful conditional is the `in` keyword. This checks if a certain item is in an iterable (a list, array, or string)\n",
    "\n",
    "## First Task\n",
    "\n",
    "* Assign a list, `L1`, with elements `[1,2,3]`\n",

    "* Create a new list `L2` with elements `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]`\n",
    "* Create a third list `L3` by setting it equal to `L1`\n",
    "* Use `==` to check if `L1` is the same as `L2` and `L3`\n",
    "* Use `is` to check if `L1` is the same as `L2` and `L3`\n",
    "* Use == to check if `L1` is the same as `A1` - note the new behavior here\n",
    "* Use `<` to determine which elements of `L1` and `A1` are less than 2 - note the new behavior here\n",
    "* Use `in` to determine if the number 3 is in A1\n",
    "* Use `in` to determine if the substring `central` is in the string `'concentration_cental_ng_per_mL'` (copy and paste to ensure you're using exactly the same strings\n",
    "* Use `in` to determine if the item `'concentration_central_ng_per_mL'` is in the list `['concentration_peripheral_ng_per_mL', 'concentration_central_ng_per_L', 'concentration_central_ng_per_mL', 'RO_central', 'RO_peripheral\"']` (copy and paste the list to ensure youre using the exact same list)"

    "# Iterating\n",
    "Iterating is a tool used to perform a task multiple times based on some method of counting. For example you may say that for every element in some list, perform a function on that element.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic set up while iterating looks something like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "set up condition:\n",
    "    task to perform\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the colon at the end of the set up line\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nesting\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is unique in that indentation is used to nest code instead of brackets or keywords such as end. This was done in order to promote clear and understandable code. Whenever you need to nest a new block of code, it gets indented further to the right. One issue that this causes is the beginner's mistake, `IndentationError`, where the code looks like it is indented properly, but it isn't. This usually occurs because spaces and tabs were mixed together.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use nesting to differentiate between the set up of a iterated loop and the function performed in that loop. We also use nesting to differentiate between the set up of a function and the action performed in that function (we'll get to that later).\n",
    "\n",
    "## `for` loops\n",
    "The `for` loop in python works similarly to a `for` or `foreach` loop in other languages. The basic syntax is for `i in iterable:`, an iterable can be anything with the `__getitem__` method, but for our purposes it will most often be a `list`, `dictionary`, `tuple` or `set` works. The loops will run for each item in the iterable. If you want to only run a subset of the iterable, you can slice it or use list comprehension (which we'll get to later).\n",
    "\n",
    "When iterating over a dictionary, you would typically want to iterate over the keys which you can do by simply calling the dictionary in the loop or using `dictionary.keys()` in the loop. If you want to iterate over the values, you must use `dictionary.values()` in the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "## range\n",
    "If you would like to quickly create an iterable of an incrementing integer list, you can use the range function. `range(n)` quickly creates a list from 0 to n-1, which is n times. Range can also define a start value and the step value if you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Third task\n",
    "* create a list `A = [1, 2, 3, 4]`\n",
    "* use a for loop to create a new list `B` where the elements of `B` are the elements of `A` squared\n",
    "    * Note: in python to take a number to a power you must use `**` instead of `^`\n",
    "    * Hint 1: you can use the `.append()` method mentioned briefly in the Intro notebook\n",
    "    * Hint 2: you can create an empty list\n",
    "    * Hint 3: you can determine the length of a list by using `len(list)`\n"
