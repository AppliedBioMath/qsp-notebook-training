    "# Basic Python Workshop - Introduction\n",
    "In this workshop we will go over importing packages and basic data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this session we will only import native python packages and do not require interfacing with our custom software. We will work with numpy for numerical analysis, pandas for its convenient data table manipulations, and plotnine for plotting purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# How to import a package\n",
    "When importing a package there are four main ways to do this.\n",
    "1. `import package`\n",
    "\n",
    "    This imports everything in the package and labels all functions and attributes of that package with the package name. For example, if you were to use `import numpy` you would then call the `arange` function from `numpy` by using `numpy.arange`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `import package as shortname`\n",
    "\n",
    "    This imports the package and labels all functions and attributes of that package with the `shortname` you defined. For example, if you were to use `import numpy as np` you would then call the `arange` function from `numpy` by using `np.arange`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `from package import *`\n",
    "\n",
    "    This imports all functions and attributes within the package without tagging them as part of the same package. The `*` here means \"everything\". For example, if you were to use `from numpy import *`, you would then call the `arange` function from `numpy` by using `arange`. This can be dangerous if two packages have the same function and you import the contents of both of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `from package import function` or `from package import function as shortfun` or `import package.function as shortfun`\n",
    "\n",
    "   This imports the listed function from the package instead of importing the entire package. The second and third options are identical. If the function or attribute you are importing has attributes of its own, the second and third options are usually useful as you can use a shortened name to call additional attributes (like in bullet point 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry too much about the details of how to use these packages yet. We will get to that later in the workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "## First Task\n",
    "For now, let's import two packages\n",
    "1. `numpy` as `np`\n",
    "2. `pandas` as `pd`\n"

    "# Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "The most commonly used data types that we will cover are:\n",
    "* `int` - integer\n",
    "* `float` - floating point number (decimal places)\n",
    "* `str` - string\n",
    "* `list` - an ordered list of objects surrounded by square brackets [ ] and separated by commas\n",
    "* `dict` - a dictionary of keys and values (may be ordered or unordered)\n",
    "* `numpy.ndarray` - an array object (think vector or matrix)\n",
    "* `pandas.DataFrame` - a dataframe object (think table)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to see all the attributes or functions you can use on each of these obect types use the `dir` function. Ex: `dir(list)`\n",
    "\n",
    "These data types can be sorted into two categories:\n",
    "1. Mutable: `list`, `dict`, `numpy.array`, `pandas.DataFrame`\n",
    "2. Immutable: `str`, `float`, `int`\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutable objects cannot be changed once created, while mutable ones can. This is important because when you are assigning a variable, you are not creating a new object - but instead stating that the variable references an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we say `x = 1`, this means that `x` references the object `1`. If I then say `x = x+1`, it will now say that `x` references the object `2`. You can use the `id` function to show that between these two steps the identity of the variable has changed. This works because 1 and 2 are `int`s and are immutable."

    "\n",
    "Besides using these functions you can also interact with lists by using indices. Python begins indexing with 0. So the first element of L is `L[0]`. The last element of L is `L[-1]`. And you can select a subset of values from L by using python index notation `first:last:step` where `first` is the first value to keep, `step` is the step size (1 corresponds to keeping every element, 2 corresponds to every other, etc), and `last` is one index past the last element you wish to keep.\n",
